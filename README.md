Now that you have a Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and .dockerignore in place, you can build the Docker image for your Flask app.

In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile, and run the following command:

bash
Copy
docker build -t flask-todo-app .
This will create an image named flask-todo-app based on your Dockerfile.

5. Run the Docker Container:

docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-todo-app

This will start the Flask app inside the Docker container and expose port 5000 to your localhost. You should now be able to access the app at http://localhost:5000.

docker-compose up --build
